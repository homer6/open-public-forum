# Open Public Forum

TL;DR - This is a project to create and operate a technology-enabled, international legal system.

Unified Action, Universal Impact.

The International Governance & Assistance Foundation (IGAF) is a non-profit organization dedicated to fostering global transparency, accountability, and collaboration. Its mission is to create a unified, blockchain-backed platform that primarily facilitates class action lawsuits, allowing entities of any scale, from individuals to nations, to join collectively in seeking justice in **class action lawsuits**. Beyond this, IGAF offers advisory services, resolution mechanisms, quality assurance, and education across multiple sectors. Governed by a rotating Board of Trustees and supported by specialized departments, IGAF strives to ensure every entity's voice is heard and their grievances addressed in a fair, transparent manner.

IGAF is dedicated to truth, justice, assistance, transparency, cooperation, and leveraging AI to design fresh, new, wholistic, **effective, and impactful policy** at all levels.

The world has many challenges. This system is designed to move us in the direction of solving them.

All data, code, AI models, and all other intellectual materials produced by IGAF are freely accessible and open sourced under the MIT License. Also, this license can only change in the direction of more permissive and transparent. We chose the MIT License because it's widely recognized as one of the most permissive license in the world every item produced or acquired by this project is public domain (owned by the public).


## Target Outcomes:

1. **Enhanced Accountability:** Entities, whether nations or corporations, are held to global standards of conduct.
2. **Improved Transparency:** Clear, tamper-proof records ensure actions are transparent.
3. **Efficient Assistance:** Entities in need can quickly access resources and help.
4. **Elevated Quality:** Whether in journalism, science, or policy, standards are raised.
5. **Global Collaboration:** An integrated platform fosters global cooperation and mutual assistance.



## Article 1 Prompt

I want to create a new international legal system where any individual, company, organization, country, or collection of countries, or any combination of the above (hereafter referred to as entity), can sue any other entities promptly, fairly, and most importantly, bindingly with real damages.

What's currently available to do this? What would this system look like if it were invented?

## Article 1 Response

The idea of a new international legal system is ambitious and intriguing. Before delving into a potential design, it's worth understanding the current international legal mechanisms in place and their limitations:

### Current International Legal Mechanisms:

1. **International Court of Justice (ICJ):** Located in The Hague, Netherlands, the ICJ is the primary judicial branch of the United Nations. It settles disputes between states and gives advisory opinions on international legal issues referred to it by the UN. Its jurisdiction is consensual, meaning both parties have to agree to submit to its authority.

2. **International Criminal Court (ICC):** Also located in The Hague, the ICC is designed to prosecute individuals for the gravest atrocities, such as genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. It does not have jurisdiction over states, but rather over individuals.

3. **Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA):** This is an intergovernmental organization with 121 member states. The PCA provides services for the resolution of disputes involving states, state entities, intergovernmental organizations, and private parties.

4. **WTO Dispute Settlement System:** This system addresses disputes between member countries over trade issues.

5. **Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs) and Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS):** Many countries have BITs that allow foreign investors to sue host states if they believe their rights under the treaty are violated.

6. **Regional Courts:** Examples include the European Court of Human Rights and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, which hear cases regarding violations of regional human rights conventions.

### Limitations:

1. **Jurisdiction:** Many international bodies, like the ICJ, require mutual consent for jurisdiction. This can make it hard to bring a case if one party refuses.

2. **Enforcement:** Even when a judgment is rendered, enforcement can be a challenge. There's no global police force to ensure compliance.

3. **Sovereignty:** States are protective of their sovereignty. They often resist international mechanisms they perceive as infringing upon their domestic jurisdiction.

### Designing a New System:

1. **Universal Membership:** The system should be open to all types of entities, as you've specified.

2. **Binding Arbitration:** The decisions of this court should be binding, meaning that all parties who submit to its jurisdiction must comply with its rulings.

3. **Enforcement Mechanism:** This is the most challenging aspect. A possibility could be an international enforcement body, but this would be heavily debated. Another method could be economic or diplomatic sanctions against entities that don't comply.

4. **Tiered Structure:** Given the varied entities that can be involved, having a tiered system (local, regional, global) might help manage the caseload and ensure that cases are heard at the appropriate level.

5. **Multiple Chambers:** Different chambers can be created based on the nature of the dispute: trade, human rights, environmental, etc.

6. **Neutral Panel:** The judges or arbitrators should be from neutral countries/entities and should be rotated frequently to avoid any bias.

7. **Transparent Processes:** All proceedings should be open to the public, with exceptions for sensitive matters. This ensures trust in the system.

8. **Funding:** A shared funding mechanism where member entities contribute based on their GDP or some other metric could be considered. This will ensure the court's independence.

9. **Appeals Mechanism:** Like any robust legal system, there should be an avenue to appeal decisions.

10. **Advisory Role:** Beyond dispute resolution, this body could play an advisory role, offering interpretations of international law upon request.

Creating such a system would be a monumental task, requiring significant diplomatic negotiation and likely facing resistance from many quarters. But if realized, it would represent a significant evolution in the way international disputes are resolved.




## Article 2 Prompt

I want to do the same thing for journalism. Same questions.

## Article 2 Response

Creating an international system for journalism, where the aim is to establish a fair, prompt, and binding process to address issues related to journalistic integrity, misinformation, and other challenges, is a noble endeavor. Here's an overview of the current mechanisms, their limitations, and a potential design for such a system:

### Current Mechanisms:

1. **National Press Councils/Ombudsmen:** Many countries have national press councils or ombudsman systems to address complaints about journalistic ethics and standards. However, their recommendations are often non-binding.

2. **International Press Institutes:** Organizations like the International Press Institute and Reporters Without Borders work globally to promote free press and journalistic integrity. They often issue reports and rankings.

3. **Fact-checking Organizations:** With the rise of misinformation online, several international organizations, like Poynter's International Fact-Checking Network, have emerged to fact-check and debunk false information.

### Limitations:

1. **Jurisdiction:** Different countries have different standards for journalism, and not all countries will accept the jurisdiction of an international body.

2. **Freedom of the Press:** There's a risk that a governing body could be seen as infringing on press freedom. Balancing accountability with freedom is a challenge.

3. **Bias and Neutrality:** Any organization can be accused of bias, which could undermine its credibility.

4. **Enforcement:** Like the legal system, ensuring compliance is a challenge. How do you enforce journalistic standards internationally?

### Designing a New System:

1. **Universal Membership:** Open to all journalistic entities, from individual bloggers to major news corporations.

2. **Binding Arbitration:** A system where disputes and complaints about journalistic practices can be adjudicated. However, the "binding" nature might be challenging due to freedom of press concerns.

3. **Enforcement Mechanism:** Rather than punitive measures, the system could rely on public accountability. Accreditation from this body could be a mark of trustworthiness, and losing that accreditation could be a significant blow to a journalistic entity's reputation.

4. **Tiered Structure:** Like the legal system, this could have local, regional, and global tiers to manage varied issues.

5. **Expert Panels:** Panels of experienced journalists, media scholars, and ethicists from diverse backgrounds could adjudicate disputes.

6. **Transparent Processes:** Transparency would be paramount. All decisions, processes, and reasonings should be public to ensure trust.

7. **Funding:** To maintain independence, funding could come from a mix of member fees, independent grants, and public contributions. Avoiding government or corporate funding would be crucial to prevent perceptions of bias.

8. **Education and Training:** Beyond addressing disputes, this body could offer training, resources, and best practices to elevate the standards of journalism worldwide.

9. **Appeals Mechanism:** Journalistic entities should have the right to appeal decisions.

10. **Collaboration with Tech Platforms:** Given the role of social media and search engines in disseminating news, collaboration with these platforms could be vital. Platforms could prioritize content from accredited members, for instance.

This proposal would face challenges, particularly from entities resistant to oversight or those fearing a compromise in press freedom. However, with the rise of misinformation and declining trust in media, a system that boosts journalistic integrity could be invaluable.






## Article 2 Prompt

I want to do the same thing for scientific research. Same questions.

## Article 2 Response

Creating an international system for scientific research that focuses on ensuring the integrity, accuracy, and transparency of research outcomes is a significant endeavor. Here's a look into the current mechanisms, their limitations, and a potential design for such a system:
